# x86 Assembly - Integer to String Converter
This program prompts the user for 10 integers (positive or negative). 
It reads those numbers as strings and converts them to integers using string primitive instructions.
It then calculates the sum and average of those integers. Finally, the program converts those integers
back to strings using string primitives (including sum and average), and displays the values as strings.
